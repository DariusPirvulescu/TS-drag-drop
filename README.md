# Drag and Drop App - TS

This is a simple app that allows users to create **Projects** (with *title*, *description*, *num of people assigned*), which will initially be pushed to the *Active Projects* field and the user will eventually be able to drag them into the *Finished Projects* field.

Built with an OOP approach so that it utilizes most of the basic TypeScript notions.
